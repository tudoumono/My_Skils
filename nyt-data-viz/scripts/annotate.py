"""
Annotation linter — the single biggest delta between a default chart and an
NYT-grade chart is annotation. This module audits a chart spec and returns
specific, actionable fixes.

The NYT discipline:
  1. EVERY chart has a headline (declarative — tell me what to see).
  2. EVERY chart has a subtitle that names the unit and timeframe.
  3. EVERY chart has a source line.
  4. Lines are LABELED DIRECTLY at their endpoints, never via legend.
  5. The "hero" data point is annotated in-place ("peak: 4.2M cases, Jan 2022").
  6. Axis labels are written like English, not like spreadsheet column names.
  7. Y-axis 0 line is bold; gridlines are very pale; no axis spine.
  8. Where the data has a known inflection, ANNOTATE IT ("Lehman collapse",
     "vaccines available," "March 2020 lockdown") — context lives ON the chart.

Input: a dict describing the chart. Output: list of {severity, message, fix}.
